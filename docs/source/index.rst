Welcome to python-ProFeld's documentation!
==========================================

predictive maintenance predict a specific member's future performance giving its historical feature data. It encompasses a variety of topics, including but not limited to: failure prediction, failure diagnosis (root cause analysis), failure detection, failure type classification, and recommendation of mitigation or maintenance actions after failure. It's helpful to reduce repair costs, reduce production down time and improve worker safety.

Predictive maintenance differs from preventive maintenance because it relies on the actual condition of equipment, rather than average or expected life statistics, to predict when maintenance will be required, so predictive maintenance gives personal prediction service.

Preventive maintenance consider all samples statistical property, instead of each member's, we can decide to maintain or not when the operation time reaches the mean time. Survival analysis do the similar thing, but it can also predict the whole sample's future performance. So that's why we use survival analysis in Mercedes, to evaluate vehicle issue's future performance.
