# Survival_analysis
An application of survival analysis. 
Predictive maintenance encompasses a variety of topics, including but not limited to: failure prediction, failure diagnosis (root cause analysis), failure detection, failure type classification, and recommendation of mitigation or maintenance actions after failure.
Repair Costs
Production Down Time
Worker Safety

# Why this repository
Survival analysis, is important for me. This is where my career starts. I joined Mercedes and worked in Reliability and Quality Field Sensor(QFS) after graduation, working together with great Dr. Andreas Jacobi and Christoph Jordan to predict the vehicle's future performance.
After that, I learned programming, machine learning step by step, slowly but continuously. 
Now I have left Mercedes, it's a good time for me to have an overview about that. Cheers for the great time!!!



This repository only include my own understanding of survival analysis and will not include any confidential information. Sor sure, my colleagues will have deeper understanding about that.

## Introduction
The project is to predict the warranty claims' future development, so that we can sense the series issues in advance, as well as measure the vehicle's quality performance in the field for automotive industry
1. create data (if necessary)
2. load data (it supportes different data sources)
3. create features (refer to [introduction](https://github.com/LongxingTan/Time_series_prediction/blob/master/create_features_intro.ipynb))
4. prepare model input
5. model
6. run prediction
